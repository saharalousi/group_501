This dataset belongs to one of the project I was working with.
The title of the project is: Cell wall related gene annotation in Cannabis sativa using the annotated reference protein sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana.

My aim is to better understand which genes encode for cellwall related proteins in Cannabis sativa.
I have a set of cell wall related protein sequences that were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, and during this project I will be using some Bioinformatic tools to do the annotation.
The output of this annotation is a .csv tables.

Throughout the process I can keep updating this file to better provide information on the outputs.
